This project plans to utilize Svelte, a UI framework I have been excited to learn about and use, alongside ASP.NET, Python, and MySQL. I also have not used either of those languages in the past...

Needless to say, this is a playground. I desire these tools to be my prefered 'stack', however this is just a playground with a real end-goal.

This project's goal is to allow users access to mentors, be able to talk to them about any topic, but in particular, I want them to be able to upload videos of a mentor they have, and create on of their own(for a fee). This project was inspired by the many AI chatbots I have seen with my own selfish twist. I want to create, and give access to elderly mentors in our lives so people can enjoy their quips, and wisdom even if their time is dearly limited.
